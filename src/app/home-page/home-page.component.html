    <h1>Kanban Notes</h1>

  <p>
    One of the major issues faced everyday by everyone in this modern era which is full of distractions, is to remember the important and mundane tasks. Everyone at some point has been at a situation where he/she thinks they are forgetting something important and this is a very common issue, in order to solve this particular issue I have developed an idea to help everyone in need.
    A synchronized detailed notes app website which will have a login page, a sign up page and a notes page with ability to create multiple notes in a kanban board style, which will help you remember tasks and prioritize them. This will also help users to be more productive and never forget important tasks. The main advantage of this website is the ability to check the notes from whatever device at any point as the data will be saved per account and no extra storage will be needed as there is no extra app to download and install or setup an application, just login and see your notes, modify them, etc. The frontend is developed using Angular with the help of bootstrap and it is hosted on Vercel. This simple project is helpful for solving everyday issues of students, working professionals and everyone else to digitally store, access and remember their tasks from any device at any time. The UI is based on kanban style board to keep it user-friendly and easy to understand. It also makes the users aware of a very useful technology used in keeping track of everyday tasks. This website can also be used as a logging website for people with special care or older patients of dementia as well as people who generally suffer from memory disorientation. There is an easy login function like login with google to help these people as even remembering passwords is also a difficult task.</p>
